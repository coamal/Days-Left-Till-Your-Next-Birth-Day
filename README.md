1.	This program calculates the approximate days remain
	till your next birth day.
2.	I mean approximate because there are a few assumptions
3.	If the actual birthday was on a leap year, on February 29,
	then the successive birthday on a non-leap year 
	is assumed to be on February 28th.
4.	Other birthdays are assumed as same
